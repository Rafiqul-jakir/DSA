# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to various data structures and algorithms. Each topic is organized into separate folders for easy navigation and understanding.

### ***What are Data Structures?***
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

#### Types of Data Structure
- Linear data structure
- Non-linear data structure

#### Linear data structure
In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.      

However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.  
#### Popular linear data structures are:
- Array 
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
#### Non-linear data structure
 elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.   
 
***Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data structures.***  
#### 1. Graph Data Structure
In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.
#### Popular Graph Based Data Structures:
- Spanning Tree and Minimum Spanning Tree
- Strongly Connected Components
- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

#### 2. Trees Data Structure
Similar to a graph, a tree is also a collection of vertices and edges. However, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.
#### Popular Tree based Data Structure
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- B-Tree
- B+ Tree
- Red-Black Tree
